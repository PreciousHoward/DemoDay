       <p> My name is Precious Howard.I live in Chicago.I am seventeen years old and I am  a junior in high school.
      .I go to Ace Tech Charter High School.I go to Ace because it's a good school that teaches you about architecture, engeneering, and construction.
      I felt that Ace could really be a good experience for me.When I graduate I want to go to college to study fashion design.
      I want to go to The International college of design and technology.Then after college I plan on opening up a boutique in New York and 
      becoming on of the top designers in the world.Currently I am apart of the Englewood Codes Program.It is a program that teaches teens how to code 
      and make websites.I jioned this program because I felt learning to make wedsites could be fun and could be a good benifit for my future plans.
      I feel we should make wedsites that can help are community, like a website that can help find losted children and to stop the violence in are
      neighborhoods.Lets save englewood.</p>
